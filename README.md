## [JavaScript Bookmarklets](https://autoraidapi.github.io/bookmarklets/)

The effectiveness of these utilities will vary depending on the browser. 

Typically these links will execute once you click them unless the link has been sanitized. 

You can also paste them into the browsers URL from your clipboard and once your press enter it `should` execute the code on the current page.

For the BlackBerry 10 webkit browser, you can save them into the browsers bookmarks and reuse them over any other page.
